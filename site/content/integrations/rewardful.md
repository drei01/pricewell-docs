In the following article, we are going to explain how to set up your [Rewardful](https://www.getrewardful.com/?via=pricewell) affiliate program with PriceWell.

We'll go through:

* Configuring PriceWell with your Rewardful API key
* Installing the Rewardful snippet on your website
* Configuring PriceWell to send affiliate data to Rewardful

## Configuring PriceWell with your Rewardful API key

If you haven't already, you'll need to create a Rewardful account. You can do that [here](https://www.getrewardful.com/?via=pricewell).

Once you have configured your affiliate campaign, you need to **copy your Rewardful API key**. Your API Secret can be found on the [Company Settings](https://app.getrewardful.com/company/edit?via=pricewell) page in Rewardful.

| ⚠️  Keep your API key safe. Never share it over email or chat   |
|-----------------------------------------|

Once you have copied your API key, head to PriceWell and click on the [**Integrations**](https://app.pricewell.io/app/integrations) tab. Then click on the [**Rewardful Integration**](https://app.pricewell.io/app/integrations/rewardful).

## Installing the Rewardful snippet on your website

Installing the Rewardful snippet is different for each website builder. You can find instructions for your website builder over at [Rewardful's Help Center](https://help.rewardful.com/en/articles/2051896-install-rewardful-on-your-websiteacking-snippet).

## Configuring PriceWell to send affiliate data to Rewardful

PriceWell will automatically send affiliate data to Rewardful when a customer purchases a subscription as long as you have followed the instructions above to install the Rewardful snippet on your website. We also support adding a [coupon code](https://help.rewardful.com/en/articles/3024552-double-sided-incentives) (known as double-side incentives in Rewardful) to the affiliate link. So your customers can get a discount and your affiliates can get a commission.
