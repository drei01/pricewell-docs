When you sell your business (congratulations by the way ðŸŽ‰), you will need to transfer your PriceWell account to the new owner. This article will show you how to do this.

#### Step 1: Have the new owner create a Stripe account

If you aren't transferring your Stripe account, the new owner will need to create a new Stripe account. This is the cleanest way to transfer your business without retaining any unwanted data.

#### Step 2: Have the new owner connect their Stripe account to PriceWell

The new owner will need to connect their Stripe account to their own PriceWell. This can be done by following the steps in [this article](/getting-started/connecting-a-stripe-account/). Again, this is the cleanest way to transfer your business without retaining any unwanted data.

##### Paid Accounts

If you are on a paid account, you will need to ask the new owner to set up their own subscription before the transfer.

#### Step 3: Copy products from your Stripe account to the new owner's Stripe account

Because Stripe is the source of truth for your products, you will need to copy your products from your Stripe account to the new owner's Stripe account. This can be done by [reaching out to Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/copy-existing-account-data-to-a-new-stripe-account).

#### Step 4: Reach out to PriceWell support

Once you have completed the above steps, you will need to reach out to PriceWell support to transfer your PriceWell account to the new owner. This can be done by sending an email to support\[at\]pricewell.io

We'll need to know the following things:

- The email address of the new owner
- Confirmation that you agree to the transfer of your PriceWell account (an irreversible action)
