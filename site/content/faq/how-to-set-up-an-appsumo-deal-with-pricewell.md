## What is Appsumo?

Appsumo is the leading daily deals website. Essentially is a space for people selling digital products and services to potential buyers with [LifeTime Deals (LTDs)](https://help.appsumo.com/article/34-what-is-a-lifetime-deal).

## How does AppSumo Work?

Appsumo operates in a pretty straightforward way. Every week they announce new products listed on their platform and they create deals for the potential buyers, while highlighting the desired features of each product.\

From writing the copy to beta testing the product and preparing a review, they become true partners.\
\
There is also a self-serve version of launching on AppSumo, where people list their product or service under the category they are interested in, while providing Coupon Codes along with LTDs to lure buyers into trying out the product.
