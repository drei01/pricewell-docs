You can set custom CSS for your Pricing Page in "Design" under "Custom CSS" -> "Show Custom CSS"



By default, blank selectors for all possible classes are shown. You can add your own styles there and the preview will update live.

Customizing Button CSS

When customizing the button CSS, you may want to turn off "Promoted Plan" in order to customize the color of all buttons on your page. You can do this by clicking the cog under the preview.
